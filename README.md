# TackingMaster
_A sailing-app for Garmin watch_

## Purpose

This is a simple app for Garmin watches that provides useful information for sailboats that do not have wind instruments.
Set wind direction and read close-hauled direction, course over ground and speed.
Observe wind turns and speed-changes, and see the consequences and make good decisions.

## Use

The direction where the wind comes from is allways facing up on the clock, and the top number is the direction against the wind-eye. The blue "N" shows the direction to north. The red dot, and gray boat show your course over ground direction.

In the center circle, course over ground is displayed. The green number is speed. In addition, plot can be displayed for historical speed changes, and historical course-shifts.

The up and down buttons can be used for adjusting the wind direction with 5 degree increments.

By pressing menu (hold up button) the wind direction can be defined on either port, or starboard close-hauled direction. There are also some settings available from the menu

The tack angle is defined to 90 degrees.
