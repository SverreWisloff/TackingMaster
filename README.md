# TackingMaster
_A sailing-app for Garmin watch_

## Purpose

This is a simple app for Garmin watches that provides useful information for sailboats that do not have wind instruments.
Set wind direction and read close-hauled direction, heading direction and speed.
Observe wind turns, and see the consequences and make good decisions.

## Use

The direction where the wind comes from is allways facing up on the clock, and the top number is the direction against the wind-eye. The blue "N" shows the direction to north. The red dot show your course over ground direction.

The up and down buttons can be used for adjusting the wind direction with 5 degree increments.

By pressing menu (hold up button) the wind direction can be defined on either port, or starboard close-hauled direction.

The tack angle is defined to 90 degrees.
