# TackingMaster
_A sailing-app for Garmin watch_

## Purpose

This is a simple app for Garmin watches that provides useful information for sailboats that do not have wind instruments.
Set wind direction and read close-hauled direction, heading direction and speed.
You can then also observe wind turns, see the consequences and make good decisions.

## Use

The direction where the wind comes from is up on the clock, and the top number is the direction against the wind-eye. The blue "N" shows the direction to north.

With the up and down buttons you can adjust the wind direction with 5 degree increments.

By pressing menu (hold up button) the wind direction can be defined on on either port and starboard close-hauled direction.

The tack angle is set to 90 degrees.

The code for the app is here:
